This mod makes creative flying faster by sprinting while flying in creative mode.

There are five config options in the fast_creative_flight.json file.
"enableFastCreativeFlight":true, //This will enable or disable the mod.
"allowOnServers":false, // If this is true this mod will work in multiplayer.

These config options control the speed. Please change these to your preferred values:
"speedBoostX":0.1,
"speedBoostY":0.5,
"speedBoostZ":0.1
